# Logistic-Regression-Classification
Using data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, I have used logistic regression to create a classification model.

This model uses three factors: glucose levels, blood pressure(mmHg), and BMI to predict whether or not a patient will eventually develop diabetes. The model labels blue datapoints as people who did experience an onset of diabetes and orange dots to represent those who didn't.

The dataset that is used can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.
